# Background
For  this  exercise  we  are  going  to  create  a  simple  database  using  the  data  from  the  books.csv  file provided.

# Instructions
- Create a script named **books.py**.
  - Write  a  function  named  **input_data()**  that  will  open  the  CSV  file  and  load  it  into  a  single-table database.
  - The structure of the database can be whatever you choose, so long as it follows the Database connection conventions we covered in lecture.
  - Name this database you created **books.db**.
 - Write docstrings for each method. (**__init__()** doesn’t need a docstring.)
 - Write  an  **if  __name__  ==  "__main__":**  statement  in  which  you  create  an  instance  of  your  class and  invoke  each  method  (you  don’t  have  to  explicitly  invoke  **__init__()**).  You  may  wanna  print the returned value of the info() method for testing the output of your script.
